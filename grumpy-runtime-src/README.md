This is home for Grumpy runtime. Programs produced by Grumpy depend on this Go library, which provides wrappers for system level functions like the CPython API. For instance, [it implements](runtime) Python slices, exceptions and other features on top of Go.

See [../README.md](../README.md) for details on using Grumpy.
